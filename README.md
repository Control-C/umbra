# Umbra Module

## Overview

The **Umbra** module is a powerful tool designed to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from textual data locally using an AI language model. This redacted text can then be securely sent to **Gemini** in the cloud for various generative tasks. Once a response is returned, Umbra seamlessly reintroduces the redacted PII back into the original document, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality throughout the process.

The **Umbra demo** provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how this process works, showcasing its potential through a real-world use case scenario.

## Key Features

- **Local PII Redaction**: PII is redacted on the client-side, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed during the generative process.
- **Cloud Integration**: Redacted text can be securely sent to Gemini in the cloud for processing and content generation.
- **Automated PII Reinsertion**: After Gemini returns the processed content, Umbra automatically reinserts the redacted PII into the document, maintaining the original context.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Umbra can be adapted to various industries and use cases where PII needs to be protected while leveraging cloud-based AI tools.

## Use Case: Bravo Children’s Hospital

To demonstrate the capabilities of Umbra, we present a use case involving a fictitious entity, *Bravo Children’s Hospital*. In this scenario, anonymized patient data is processed through Gemini to achieve two distinct outcomes:

### 1. Insurance Letter Generation for Doctors

- **Objective**: Assist doctors in writing letters to justify necessary treatments to insurance companies.
- **Process**:
  - The patient's medical condition is described in text, with all PII redacted by Umbra.
  - The redacted text is sent to Gemini, which generates a draft letter to the insurance company.
  - Umbra then reinserts the PII back into the letter, which the doctor reviews and sends to the insurer.
- **Benefit**: Streamlines the workflow for doctors, enabling efficient communication with insurers while protecting patient privacy.

### 2. Personalized Story Creation for Child Patients

- **Objective**: Create a personalized story for child patients based on their medical condition.
- **Process**:
  - Anonymized text about the patient's condition is used by Gemini to generate a story, featuring the child's favorite toy as the main character.
  - The story is then paired with images generated by an image AI, laid out on a single page using a third-party API.
  - The final output is a PDF file, which a nurse prints and folds into a picture book following provided instructions.
- **Benefit**: Helps children understand their medical situation in a comforting and personalized way, making their hospital experience more positive.
